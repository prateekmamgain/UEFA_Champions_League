EDA on UCL 2022 season

The file focused on carrying out EDA on UEFA Champions League 2021-22. There were several data files, which were downloaded from kaggle.
I collated them into a single dataframe for a better, streamlined analysis.

Also, some data such as 'Group Tables' and 'UEFA Team of the Year' were scraped from wikipedia for a more comrehensive analysis.

Focused areas include:
1. Goals scored by each team (Decreasing order)
2. Goals conceded by each time (Decreasing order)
3. Goals scored with respect to player position
4. Goals scored from left foot, right foot, headers, or others
5. Proportion of goals scored from either inside the box, outside the box, or from penalties
6. Pass accuracy: Club-wise
7. Distances covered: Club-wise
8. Minutes Played: Club-wise
9. Player position-wise analysis using conditional formatting in Pandas
10. UEFA Team of the Year stats
